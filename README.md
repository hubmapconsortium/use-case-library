# HuBMAP Use Case Library
The HuBMAP Use Case Library provides a list of high-level summaries that capture HuBMAP objectives. Feel free to contribute use cases! Please read this READ-ME for guidelines before submitting a new use case. 

# How to Navigate
Use cases are filed as github issues. They are categorized using pre-defined tags that indicate the high-level objectives and the relevant personas. They are also tracked in the github project tracker with the categories indicating the status of HuBMAP technologies fulfilling the use case: 'Not Started', 'In Progress' and 'Completed'. 

# How to Contribute
As a HuBMAP user or contributor, feel free to submit any use cases by submitting them as github issues in this repo. To submit an issue, follow this [github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue). 

When submitting the issue, assign the relevant, pre-defined tags that categorize them under a general HuBMAP objective, relevant personas and current status. If you are unsure about the tag(s), assign the ones you believe are relevant and the manager of this repo will check. 

For developers, if there is an issue that will address a certain use case (even if it exists in a separate repo), please tag the relevant use case when possible. This will help update the completion status as use cases become resolved.
